# Amazon IVS Android Feed demo

A demo Android phone application intended as an educational tool for demonstrating how Amazon IVS can be used to build a scrolling feed of live streams.

**This project is intended for education purposes only and not for production usage.**

This is a server-less Android application that shows a list of Amazon IVS streams in a scrolling feed. The demo is written in [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) and showcases how customers can load and play Amazon IVS streams in a feed format.

This demo loads streams and stream metadata from a json file, which is used by the app to populate a scrolling list of streams.

## Getting Started

To run this demo, you will need the following:

1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), installed and up-to-date.
2. An Android Virtual Device (AVD) Phone with **API level 23 or later** (Android 6). Learn more here: [Run apps on the Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).

To run the demo in the Android emulator:

1. Clone the project from this repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Select an Android Virtual Device with API level 23 or later.
4. Choose `Run app` in the toolbar, or press `Ctrl-R`.

You should see the Android emulator boot up and launch the demo app. This may take a few moments to complete. You can tap the heart icon (ü§ç) to spawn hearts, or the share icon (‚Üó) to open the share sheet.

## Modifying this Example

### Prerequisites

_**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Using your own stream will create and consume AWS resources, which will cost money._

1. Create and set up an Amazon IVS channel. [Getting started with Amazon IVS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/GSIVS.html).

### Using your own Live videos

This example loads streams and stream metadata from a file `streams.json`, which provides a json object containing an array of stream objects. Each stream object represents one video in the feed. To load your own IVS stream, you will need to create and stream to an IVS channel, and modify the included `streams.json` file to include the correct metadata for your stream.

```
/* Example streams.json markup */

{
  "streams": [
    {
      "id": <unique-stream-id>,
      "stream": {
        "channelArn": "<channel-ARN>",
        "health": "HEALTHY",
        "playbackUrl": "<channel-playback-url>.m3u8",
        "startTime": "<stream-start-time>",
        "state": "<live-status>",
        "viewerCount": <viewer-count>
      },
      "metadata": {
        "streamTitle": "<stream-title>",
        "userAvatar": "<streamer-avatar>",
        "userName": "<streamer-name>",
        "userColors": {
          "primary": "<streamer-color-1-hex>",
          "secondary": "<streamer-color-2-hex>"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "stream": {
        ...
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

1. Open the [Amazon IVS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ivs) and navigate to the channel(s) you would like to use.
2. Copy the _Playback URL_ for the channel(s). The URL should end in `.m3u8`.(For example: `https://fcc3ddae59ed.us-west-2.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/us-west-2.893648527354.channel.DmumNckWFTqz.m3u8`).
3. In Android Studio, open `src/main/assets/streams.json`, and paste the `.m3u8` URL(s) from step 2, into the appropriate `playbackUrl` key(s).
4. Save and build the application.

There are also several configuration options available in `com/amazonaws/ivs/player/scrollablefeed/common/Configuration.kt`.
